Done in the merge (started from the PyCharm version and bringing in things from PyDev):

- Added modules which were unused in PyCharm but are used in PyDev.

- execfile was upgraded to the PyDev version (it had errors with BOM in utf-8)


Already reviewed:

1. pycompletionserver.py
2. pydev_console_utils.py
3. pydev_ipython_console_011.py


Need reviewing later:

pydev_ipython_console_011.py:
