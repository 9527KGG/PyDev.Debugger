Done in the merge (started from the PyCharm version and bringing in things from PyDev):

- Added modules which were unused in PyCharm but are used in PyDev.

- execfile was upgraded to the PyDev version (it had errors with BOM in utf-8)

- pydevd_file_utils: automatically doing normcase

- pyded: multiprocessing supporting 2 approaches (use new connection/use same connection)

- pydev_monkey: fixes from PyDev to properly deal with windows command lines

Already reviewed:

1. pycompletionserver.py
2. pydev_console_utils.py
3. pydev_ipython_console_011.py


Need reviewing later:

pydev_ipython_console_011.py:
pydevd_comm.py: renumbered to keep all commands from pydev/pycharm.


Manual test:

* Find referrers(objects that reference to) of an object instance
* Support for IPython GUI event loop in console
* Code autoreload in debugger/console
* Ignore thrown/caught exceptions on source code

* Django template debugging
* Gevent debugging
* Smart step into
* Code block execution in python console
* Possibility of interruption of a command, executing in python console
* Collection of type information of arguments in debug mode
* Ability to stop tracing
